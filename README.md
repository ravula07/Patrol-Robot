# Patrol-Robot
This GitHub repo is an end semester project submission of the course "Robotic Operating Systems" which features the implementation of a Patrol Robot in ROS2 Humble distribution.

This project features the following things:
        => Creating a 2-Wheel Differential drive robot using xacro files
        => Integrating LIDAR sensor and camera to the Robot
        => Generating a Gazebo world that represents parking lot in a Grocery store
        => Spawning the robot in Gazebo for simulation using launch file
        => Vizualization of the simulation in rviz 
        => Localization of robot in the world by generating a map using Slam toolbox
        => Autonomously navigating our robot in the world using 2D goal pose in rviz

# Functionality
Our robot patrols the parking lot inforont of the Grocery store.
